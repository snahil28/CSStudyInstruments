First Week-

I was trying to install Crash simulator on my VM, but couldn't make it work because of some errors incurred while installing dependencies, so used the VMWare image provided by Preston. 

I went through the rr/Mozilla website and the tool writeup to understand its functioning and tested the tool on packages like - ls, fmt, tr, wc, diff, unexpand.

Found an issue in fmt, need to investigate more.
