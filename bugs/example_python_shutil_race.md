* Brief description (This can change as you progress) :

The Python shutil module has a function called copyfile that has a race
condition when the file being copied is modified. The race condition occurs
between the time when it is initially checked and when it is actually
copied.


## Updates


### Week 1

**Current Stage: Bug Identified**

Bug discovered when file move checker was used to analyze a dead trace of
shutil.rename() moving a file from one disk to another under Linux.
Further investigation revealed that this case occurs because moving a file
this way means the rename() system call cannot be used.
This leads to a fallback manual copy being performed.


### Week 2

**Current Stage: Source of Bug Diagnosed**

Further work on this bug indicates that the problem exists because there
the current implementation of the internal function copyfile() does not
double check for changes in the file being copied.  Further investigation
is required to come up with a good way to fix this.

### Week 3

**Current Stage: Bug Fix Implemented**

Analysis of coreutils mv source code indicates one approach to fix this
problem is to store the inode number of the file being moved on the initial
check. You can then confirm that it hasn't changed after being open()'d by
using fstat() on its file descriptor.  Fix has been implemented and is
available on this fork: https://github.com/myname/cpython

**Current Stage: Bug Fix Submitted to Project:**

Bug has been reported to the cpython bug tracker and as an issue on
cpython's github according to project standards.  Bug has been assigned
identifier bpo-30400.

###  Week 4

**Current Stage: Communication with Project in Progress**

Strategy implemented in fix was not accepted by project maintainers.  They
suggested an alternate strategy involving open()'ing the file as early as
possible and using file descriptor-dependent system calls from then on out
to resolve the race condition.  Currently working on this new fix

**Current Stage: Bug Fix Accepted or Merged**

Fix with suggested strategy has been submitted, accepted, and merged.  Bug
has been marked as resolved at \<Link to python bug tracker\>
